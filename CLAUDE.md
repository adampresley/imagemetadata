# Claude Rules and Guidelines

1. All requested changes, before you change any code, first display a plan outlining what components and code is going to change, the nature of each change, and a short summary of why you are going to change it. Wait for approval before making any code changes.
2. Once you complete a task, also execute `go build` to ensure the changes do not break anything
3. Do not introduce new 3rd party libraries or dependencies without first consulting me, and telling my why you have to add a new dependency
